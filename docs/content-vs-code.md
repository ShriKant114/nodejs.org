## Content vs. Code

The **Website Team** (@nodejs/nodejs-website) is primarily concerned with the code and overall structure of the website.

The content of the website comes from Node.js core collaborators, in particular, from a variety of teams and [working groups](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/main/WORKING_GROUPS.md#current-working-groups).

### Editorial Responsibilities

The Website Team has **editorial responsibility** for content quality, structure, and presentation across the website, while **technical accuracy** remains the domain of relevant Working Groups and subject matter experts.

Specifically:

- **Working Groups and teams** retain final authority over technical content within their areas of expertise
- **The Website Team** can make editorial decisions regarding content structure, clarity, formatting, and presentation
- **The Website Team** serves as the default editorial team for content areas with no assigned Working Group ownership
- **The Website Team** can proactively improve content that appears outdated, unclear, or inactive, while deferring to appropriate experts for technical validation

### Content Ownership and Collaboration

Some sections are implicitly assigned to teams based on a general consensus of what certain sections are about. An example of this policy playing out is Node.js releases blog posts. The Release WG has ownership of such content and it is free to publish it on the website. Some WGs might also have direct write access to this repository, meaning that (by using good judgement) they can approve their own Pull Requests.

When Working Groups are not actively maintaining content within their domain, the Website Team is encouraged to step in and help improve it, seeking input from the relevant experts as needed.

The Website Team may review all content for correct usage of this repository's tooling and structure, and can make editorial decisions to improve content quality and user experience. For technical accuracy, the Website Team will collaborate with or defer to the appropriate Working Groups and subject matter experts.

#### Summary

The Website Team is responsible for creating, crafting and maintaining the Node.js Website. We have editorial authority to ensure content quality and presentation, while collaborating with Node.js Core Collaborators and Working Groups who maintain technical authority in their respective domains. The Website Team actively contributes content and takes editorial responsibility for improving the overall quality and user experience of the website.
